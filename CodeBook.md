### Code variables
 
* filename - file of downloaded zip file
* act_labels - loading UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt into data frame
* features - UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt into data frame
* measures - getting mean and standard deviation measures from the features data frame... as integers
* train - loading UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt into data frame
* act_train - loading UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt into data frame
* subject_train - loading UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt into data frame
* train - combining columns of train, act_train and subject_train data frames
* test - loading UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt into data frame
